# Layer-specific test coverage configuration for StockBook
# This file defines coverage thresholds for each architectural layer

# Layer-specific configuration
layers:
  # Domain layer - 100% coverage requirement (business logic)
  domain:
    path: src/domain
    threshold: 100
    description: "Core business logic and domain entities - requires 100% coverage"
    
  # Application layer - 100% coverage requirement achieved (use cases)
  application:
    path: src/application
    threshold: 100
    description: "Application services and use cases - requires 100% coverage"
    
  # Infrastructure layer - 100% coverage requirement (persistence & integrations)
  infrastructure:
    path: src/infrastructure
    threshold: 100
    description: "Data persistence and external integrations - requires 100% coverage"
    
  # Presentation layer - 100% coverage requirement (UI & controllers)
  presentation:
    path: src/presentation
    threshold: 100
    description: "UI components and controllers - requires 100% coverage"

# Overall project coverage (100% enforcement across all layers)
# All architectural layers now require 100% coverage
# Strict quality standards applied uniformly across domain, application, infrastructure, and presentation layers
