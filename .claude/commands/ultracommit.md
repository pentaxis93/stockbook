Before you commit, I want you to try to commit. If it works, excellent, you're done. But if the commit fails due to the pre-commit pipeline tests, your mission is to systematically hunt down and correct the errors and warnings with brilliant software engineering solutions. This is our mission: to improve the codebase by using our process. You are authorized to spend as much time as you need to get this done without compromise. You'll know you've succeeded when the pre-commit tests all pass, your commit is successful, and you can verify it in the git log.
