# Strategic type ignores for Streamlit UI framework migration
# 
# These files contain broad type ignores that are strategically applied
# to accelerate type safety improvements in the core business logic layers.
#
# Reason: The dev team plans to replace Streamlit with a different UI framework.
# Investing time in perfect Streamlit typing would be wasteful.
#
# Files affected by strategic UI framework type ignores:
src/presentation/adapters/streamlit_*.py
src/presentation/coordinators/stock_page_coordinator.py

# This allows the business logic to achieve 100% type safety
# while deferring UI layer typing until framework migration
