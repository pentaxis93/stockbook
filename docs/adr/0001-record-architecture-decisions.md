# Record Architecture Decisions

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: Development team
* Date: 2025-01-11

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project to maintain a clear understanding of why certain choices were made, what alternatives were considered, and what the implications are. Without proper documentation, future developers (including ourselves) may not understand the reasoning behind architectural choices, leading to confusion and potentially poor decisions.

## Decision Drivers

* Need for transparent decision-making process
* Knowledge transfer to new team members
* Historical context for future architectural changes
* Avoid repeating discussions about already-made decisions
* Enable informed evolution of the architecture

## Considered Options

* Option 1: Use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
* Option 2: Document decisions in wiki pages
* Option 3: Keep decisions in issue tracking system
* Option 4: No formal documentation of decisions

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Option 1: Use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)", because it provides a lightweight, version-controlled way to document decisions alongside the code they affect. ADRs are a well-established pattern in the software industry and integrate well with our Git-based workflow.

### Positive Consequences

* Decisions are documented in a consistent format
* Documentation lives with the code in version control
* Changes to decisions are tracked through Git history
* Easy to reference specific decisions
* Lightweight process that doesn't impede development

### Negative Consequences

* Requires discipline to maintain
* Another type of documentation to write
* May become outdated if not maintained

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Option 1: Use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Lightweight text files stored in the repository that document significant architectural decisions.

* Good, because they live with the code
* Good, because they're version controlled
* Good, because they follow a standard format
* Good, because they're searchable and linkable
* Bad, because they require discipline to maintain

### Option 2: Document decisions in wiki pages

Use a project wiki to document architectural decisions.

* Good, because wikis are familiar to many developers
* Good, because they support rich formatting
* Bad, because they're separate from the code
* Bad, because version control is often limited
* Bad, because they can become disorganized

### Option 3: Keep decisions in issue tracking system

Document decisions as issues or in issue comments.

* Good, because it's integrated with development workflow
* Good, because it supports discussion threads
* Bad, because decisions get buried in closed issues
* Bad, because it's hard to get an overview of all decisions
* Bad, because issue trackers are often external to the code

### Option 4: No formal documentation of decisions

Rely on code comments and team memory.

* Good, because it requires no extra effort
* Bad, because knowledge is lost when team members leave
* Bad, because decisions are forgotten or misremembered
* Bad, because the same discussions happen repeatedly
* Bad, because new team members lack context
