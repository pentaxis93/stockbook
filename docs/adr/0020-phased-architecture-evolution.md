# Phased Architecture Evolution

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: Development team
* Date: 2025-01-11

## Context and Problem Statement

StockBook's architecture must evolve to support growing requirements while maintaining system stability and development velocity. We need a strategy for introducing advanced architectural patterns like CQRS and Event Sourcing without disrupting current functionality or overwhelming the team. The architecture should grow incrementally based on actual needs rather than speculative requirements. How should we plan and manage the architectural evolution of StockBook?

## Decision Drivers

* **Incremental Growth**: Architecture evolves with actual needs
* **Team Capacity**: Changes match team size and expertise
* **Business Value**: Each phase delivers tangible value
* **Risk Management**: Minimize disruption to existing features
* **Learning Opportunity**: Team gains experience gradually
* **Technical Debt**: Avoid premature optimization
* **Migration Path**: Clear path from current to future state

## Considered Options

* **Phased Evolution**: Structured phases with clear milestones
* **Big Bang Rewrite**: Complete architectural overhaul
* **Feature-Driven Evolution**: Architecture changes per feature
* **Time-Based Phases**: Fixed time periods for changes
* **Reactive Evolution**: Change only when problems arise
* **Full Implementation**: Implement everything upfront

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Phased Evolution", because it provides a structured approach to architectural growth that balances ambition with pragmatism. By defining clear phases with specific goals and prerequisites, we can evolve the architecture based on real needs while maintaining system stability. This approach allows the team to learn and adapt gradually rather than being overwhelmed by complexity.

### Positive Consequences

* **Clear Roadmap**: Everyone understands the direction
* **Manageable Changes**: Each phase is achievable
* **Risk Mitigation**: Problems isolated to phases
* **Team Growth**: Skills develop with architecture
* **Business Alignment**: Features drive phases
* **Flexibility**: Can adjust based on learning
* **Continuous Delivery**: System stays shippable

### Negative Consequences

* **Planning Overhead**: Requires thoughtful planning
* **Potential Delays**: Phases might take longer
* **Temporary Solutions**: Some interim approaches
* **Communication Need**: Must explain evolution

class Stock(Entity):
    def update_price(self, new_price: Money) -> None:
        self.price = new_price
        self.updated_at = datetime.utcnow()

# Phase 3 (Event-Driven)
class Stock(AggregateRoot):  # Now extends AggregateRoot
    def update_price(self, new_price: Money) -> None:
        old_price = self.price
        self.price = new_price
        self.updated_at = datetime.utcnow()
        
        # New: Raise domain event
        self.raise_event(StockPriceUpdatedEvent(
            stock_id=self.id,
            old_price=old_price,
            new_price=new_price
        ))

# Gradual migration with feature flags
class StockApplicationService:
    def update_stock_price(self, command: UpdatePriceCommand):
        stock = await self._repo.find_by_id(command.stock_id)
        stock.update_price(command.new_price)
        
        if self._feature_flags.is_enabled("domain_events"):
            # Publish events in Phase 3
            events = stock.pull_events()
