# Unified Development Roadmap for StockBook

*Generated from consolidated audit recommendations*

## Executive Summary

This roadmap synthesizes recommendations from two independent code audits, prioritized for a **solo developer working with an AI coding assistant**. Items that strengthen the AI assistant's ability to contribute safely and effectively are given highest priority.

## Prioritization Framework

- **游댮 Critical**: Foundational infrastructure that enables AI-assisted development
- **游리 High**: Significant productivity or quality improvements
- **游릭 Medium**: Beneficial enhancements with good ROI
- **游댯 Low**: Nice-to-have features for future consideration

## Phase 1: Foundation for AI-Assisted Development (Week 1-2)

These items create the safety net that allows an AI assistant to contribute effectively without introducing regressions.

### 游댮 1.1 CI/CD Pipeline Implementation
**Effort**: 3-5 days | **Dependencies**: None

Create automated quality gates that run on every commit:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml

- Generate coverage reports
- Block merging on failures
```

**Why Critical**: Prevents AI-generated code from breaking existing functionality. Acts as the first line of defense.

### 游댮 1.2 Docker Support & Standardized Environment
**Effort**: 1-2 days | **Dependencies**: None

### 游댮 1.3 Makefile for Standard Commands
**Effort**: 2-4 hours | **Dependencies**: None

Standardize common operations:
```makefile
test:       # Run test suite
lint:       # Run quality checks
run:        # Start development server
install:    # Setup environment
```

**Why Critical**: Provides AI with consistent command interface, reducing ambiguity in instructions.

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Solo Developer + AI Assistant

1. **Always implement safety nets first** - CI/CD, testing, and monitoring prevent AI errors
2. **Document decisions immediately** - Helps AI understand context in future sessions
3. **Prefer explicit over implicit** - Clear interfaces and types guide AI better
4. **Automate everything possible** - Reduces cognitive load and error potential
5. **Start small, iterate** - Each phase builds on previous foundations

### Success Metrics

- **Phase 1-2**: Zero regressions from AI commits
- **Phase 3-4**: 50% reduction in debugging time
- **Phase 5-6**: 2x feature delivery speed

### Risk Mitigation

- **AI Hallucinations**: Mitigated by comprehensive testing and CI/CD
- **Context Loss**: Mitigated by documentation and ADRs
- **Quality Drift**: Mitigated by automated quality gates
- **Performance Issues**: Mitigated by monitoring and profiling
