## Phase 1: Foundation for AI-Assisted Development (Week 1-2) ✅ COMPLETED

These items create the safety net that allows an AI assistant to contribute effectively without introducing regressions.

### 🔴 1.1 CI/CD Pipeline Implementation ✅ COMPLETED
**Effort**: 3-5 days | **Dependencies**: None

Create automated quality gates that run on every commit:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml

- Execute full test suite ✅
- Generate coverage reports ✅
- Block merging on failures ✅
```

**Why Critical**: Prevents AI-generated code from breaking existing functionality. Acts as the first line of defense.

**Implemented**: GitHub Actions workflow that runs pre-commit hooks on all branches and pull requests.

### 🔴 1.2 Docker Support & Standardized Environment ✅ COMPLETED
**Effort**: 1-2 days | **Dependencies**: None

- ✅ Create Dockerfile for consistent development environment

**Effort**: 2-4 hours | **Dependencies**: None

Standardize common operations:
```makefile
test:       # Run test suite ✅
lint:       # Run quality checks ✅
format:     # Format code ✅
quality:    # Run all checks (matches pre-commit) ✅
install:    # Setup environment ✅
```

**Why Critical**: Provides AI with consistent command interface, reducing ambiguity in instructions.

**Additional commands implemented**: typecheck, test-fast, test-watch, coverage-report, security, complexity, imports, docstrings, clean, and more. Run `make help` to see all available commands.
