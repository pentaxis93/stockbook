## Phase 2: Implementation Completion üî®

**Priority**: Medium | **Estimated Duration**: 3-4 days | **Status**: Pending

### 2.1 Complete Repository Implementations
**Impact**: High | **Risk**: Low | **Estimated Time**: 1-2 days

**Current State**:
- ‚úÖ Stock repository fully implemented
- ‚ùå Portfolio, Transaction, Target, PortfolioBalance, Journal repositories return "not yet implemented"

**Implementation Plan**:
```
1. Create SQLite implementations for all repository interfaces:
   - SqlitePortfolioRepository
   - SqliteTransactionRepository  
   - SqliteTargetRepository
   - SqlitePortfolioBalanceRepository
   - SqliteJournalRepository

2. Follow TDD approach:
   - Write comprehensive failing tests first
   - Implement CRUD operations with domain entity mapping
   - Add proper error handling and validation
   - Ensure thread safety

3. Integration:
   - Update composition root with new implementations
   - Update unit of work to provide access to all repositories
   - Verify dependency injection configuration
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All repository interfaces have working SQLite implementations
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for each repository
- [ ] Domain entity mapping working correctly
- [ ] Error handling matches existing Stock repository patterns

### 2.2 Fix DI Lifetime Management Issues
**Impact**: Medium | **Risk**: Medium | **Estimated Time**: 1 day

**Current Issues**:
- Database connections registered as factory (causes multiple connections)
- Unit of Work registered as singleton (thread safety concerns)
- Missing scoped lifetime implementation
- No connection pooling

**Implementation Plan**:
```
1. Database Connection Lifetime:
   - Change from factory to singleton with proper connection pooling
   - Implement thread-safe connection management
   - Add connection health checks

2. Unit of Work Scoping:
   - Implement scoped lifetime in DI container
   - Change UoW from singleton to scoped (per operation)
   - Ensure proper transaction isolation

3. DI Container Enhancements:
   - Add SCOPED lifetime support to DIContainer
   - Implement scope management for web requests
   - Add thread safety mechanisms for shared resources

4. Testing:
   - Add concurrent access tests
   - Verify transaction isolation
   - Test connection pooling behavior
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Database connections properly pooled and thread-safe
- [ ] Unit of Work correctly scoped to operations
- [ ] DI container supports scoped lifetimes
- [ ] No thread safety issues under concurrent load

### 2.3 Legacy Database Migration
**Impact**: Medium | **Risk**: Low | **Estimated Time**: 1 day

**Current State**:
- `utils/database.py` still used by some tests
- Creates parallel data access outside clean architecture
- Bypasses repository pattern validation

**Implementation Plan**:
```
1. Identify Legacy Usage:
   - Scan all test files for utils/database.py imports
   - Catalog which operations need repository equivalents
   - Plan migration strategy for each test file

2. Gradual Migration:
   - Update tests in small batches (5-10 files at a time)
   - Replace direct database calls with repository pattern
   - Maintain existing test assertions and coverage
   - Verify each batch works before proceeding

3. Legacy Cleanup:
   - Remove utils/database.py once migration complete
   - Update any documentation references
   - Ensure no hidden dependencies remain
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Zero imports of utils/database.py in test files
- [ ] All database operations go through repository pattern
- [ ] Test coverage maintained or improved
- [ ] No functionality regressions
