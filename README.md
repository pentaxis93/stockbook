# StockBook

Personal stock trading tracker for managing family investments with portfolio analytics and performance monitoring.

## Overview

StockBook is a modern application built with Python to help track personal and family stock investments. It provides a clean architecture foundation for recording trades, monitoring portfolio performance, and analyzing investment history.

## Current Status 🚧

**Phase 1 Complete**: The project has a solid foundation with Domain and Application layers fully implemented following Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design principles. The Infrastructure and Presentation layers are planned for Phase 2.

### What's Working Now
- ✅ Rich domain model with entities and value objects
- ✅ Business logic and domain services
- ✅ Application layer with commands and DTOs
- ✅ Professional dependency injection container
- ✅ Layer-specific configuration modules following clean architecture
- ✅ Base table utilities providing consistent column definitions (SQLAlchemy Core mixin pattern)
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (100% coverage on critical layers)
- ✅ Development tooling (Docker, Makefile, pre-commit hooks)
- ✅ Automated dependency updates with Dependabot

### What's Coming Next
- 🔄 Infrastructure layer (database, repositories)
- 🔄 REST API with FastAPI
- 🔄 Web UI
- 🔄 Real-time stock data integration

## Features (Planned)

- 📊 Portfolio overview dashboard
- 📝 Trade entry and management
- 📈 Performance tracking and analytics
- 💰 Profit/loss calculations
- 📅 Historical data analysis
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Multi-account support for family members

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.13 or higher
- Git
- Docker (optional, but recommended)

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stockbook.git
cd stockbook

# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build

# Or run in detached mode
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Option 2: Local Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stockbook.git
cd stockbook

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install pre-commit hooks (required for development)
pre-commit install
```

## Development

### Quick Start

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run quality checks (same as pre-commit hook)
make quality

# Format code
make format

# See all available commands
make help
```

### Development Workflow

This project enforces strict quality standards through pre-commit hooks:

1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** is mandatory
   - Write tests first
   - Implement code to make tests pass
   - Refactor while keeping tests green

2. **Type Safety** is enforced
   - All code must pass `pyright --strict`
   - Explicit type annotations required

3. **Quality Checks** run automatically
   - Format: `black` and `isort`
   - Lint: `pylint` with strict unified standards
   - Type check: `pyright` and `mypy`
   - Test: `pytest` with coverage requirements
   - Security: `bandit` and `pip-audit`

### Code Quality Standards

All code follows the **same strict quality standards** with minor allowances for legitimate test patterns:

- **Core/Production Code**: Strictest complexity and quality metrics
- **Test Code**: Same strict standards with allowances for:
  - Protected member access (testing internal state)
  - Redefined names (pytest fixtures)
  - Unused arguments (fixture side effects)
  - Attributes in setup methods

### Layer-Specific Testing

The project enforces different coverage thresholds per architectural layer:

| Layer | Required Coverage | Rationale |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| Domain | 100% | Core business logic must be fully tested |
| Application | 90% | Use cases need comprehensive coverage |
| Infrastructure | 100% | Data persistence is critical |
| Presentation | 100% | API contracts must be reliable |

Run layer coverage analysis:
```bash
python hooks/check-layer-coverage.py
```

## Architecture

StockBook follows Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                 Presentation                    │ (Planned)
│          (FastAPI, REST API, Web UI)           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                 Application                     │ ✅ Implemented
│        (Use Cases, Commands, DTOs)             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                   Domain                        │ ✅ Implemented  
│    (Entities, Value Objects, Services)         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│               Infrastructure                    │ (Planned)
│      (Database, External Services)             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

→ Dependencies flow inward (Dependency Inversion Principle)
```

For detailed architecture documentation, see [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

### Architecture Visualization

The project includes auto-generated architecture diagrams that visualize the codebase structure:

```bash
# Generate architecture diagrams
make docs-arch

# View diagrams in browser
# Open: file:///path/to/stockbook/docs/architecture/diagrams/viewer.html
```

The system generates 12 comprehensive diagrams including:
- C4 Model diagrams (System Context, Container, Component, Code levels)
- Clean Architecture visualizations (layers, onion model, dependencies)
- Domain-Driven Design diagrams (entities, aggregates, value objects)
- Dependency injection container structure

All diagrams are automatically kept in sync with the codebase.
