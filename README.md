- **SQLite** - Local database for data persistence
- **Clean Architecture** - Layered architecture with dependency inversion
- **Domain-Driven Design** - Rich domain models and business logic
- **Dependency Injection** - Professional IoC container for testability
- **Test-Driven Development** - Comprehensive test coverage with TDD approach

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stockbook.git
cd stockbook

# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

## Development Status

🏗️ **Architecture Complete, Integration Phase** - Clean architecture foundation is complete, now integrating with main application.

### Completed Architecture (Phase 0) ✅

**Clean Architecture Implementation**
- Complete 4-layer architecture (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Presentation)
- Professional dependency injection with IoC container and composition root
- Rich domain models with business logic and invariants
- Repository pattern with clean separation of concerns
- Comprehensive error handling and validation

**Shared Kernel & Domain-Driven Design**
- Value objects (Money, Quantity) with arithmetic operations and business rules
- Domain events infrastructure with serialization and ordering
- Domain exception hierarchy with context and severity levels
- Domain services for portfolio calculation, stock validation, and risk assessment
- Test-driven development with 183 shared kernel tests

**Legacy Foundation (Phase 1)**
- Database schema with 6 tables and relationships  
- Pydantic models with comprehensive validation
- Database operations with full CRUD functionality
- Centralized configuration management
- UI component library and navigation framework

### Current Phase: Integration & Feature Development

**Test Coverage**: 829 tests (695 passing, 134 placeholder)
**Architecture Compliance**: 100% clean architecture principles
**Code Quality**: Type-safe with comprehensive error handling
