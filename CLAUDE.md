- Always use the TDD approach when possible.
  - Write tests first to define the expected behavior.
  - The tests should fail. At this point, simply allow the tests to fail, rather than skipping them or commenting them out.
  - Implement the code to make the tests pass.
  - Refactor the code to make it more readable.
- When writing git commit messages, omit all references to authorship, and especially omit references to Claude.
- Always update the ROADMAP.md and README.md files in the project root with the latest changes.
