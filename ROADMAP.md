# StockBook Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the structured development approach for StockBook, prioritizing foundational architecture before implementing user-facing features to ensure a maintainable and robust application.

## Current Status

âœ… **Completed**
- Database schema with 6 tables and proper relationships
- Database utility classes with comprehensive CRUD operations
- Test suite covering all database operations (100% coverage)
- Basic Streamlit app structure with navigation framework

ðŸ”„ **In Progress**
- Early development phase with foundational architecture needed

## Development Philosophy

**Architecture First**: Build solid foundations before features to ensure:
- Maintainable and scalable codebase
- Consistent user experience
- Robust error handling
- Type safety and validation

---

## Phase 1: Core Architecture (Foundation)
*Priority: Critical - Must complete before UI development*

### 1.1 Data Models with Validation
**Problem**: Currently using raw dictionaries for data handling
**Goal**: Type-safe data models with validation

- [x] Create Pydantic models for all entities:
  - `Stock` - Symbol validation, grade constraints
  - `Portfolio` - Name validation, risk percentage limits
  - `Transaction` - Price/quantity validation, date handling
  - `Target` - Price relationship validation (pivot vs failure)
  - `PortfolioBalance` - Balance validation, date constraints
  - `JournalEntry` - Content validation, optional relationships
- [x] Add data validation methods (stock symbol format, date ranges)
- [x] Implement type conversion utilities
- [x] Create model factories for database row conversion
- [x] Add comprehensive validation error messages

### 1.2 Configuration Management
**Problem**: Hardcoded paths and constants scattered throughout code
**Goal**: Centralized configuration system

- [x] Create `config.py` module with:
  - Database connection settings
  - File paths
  - Constants
  - Display preferences
  - Date format standards
  - Validation rules (symbol patterns, grade options)
  - Feature flags for development phases
- [x] Configuration validation on startup
- [x] Comprehensive unit test suite for configuration system
- [ ] Update existing code to use centralized config

### 1.3 Error Handling and User Feedback System
**Problem**: Minimal error handling and user feedback
**Goal**: Consistent error management and user messaging

- [ ] Create custom exception classes:
  - `ValidationError` - Data validation failures
  - `DatabaseError` - Database operation failures
  - `BusinessLogicError` - Application rule violations
- [ ] Implement error logging system
- [ ] Create user-friendly error message mapper
- [ ] Add error boundary for Streamlit components
- [ ] Implement success/info message system
- [ ] Add error recovery suggestions

### 1.4 UI Component Library
**Problem**: Need reusable Streamlit components
**Goal**: Consistent and reusable UI elements

- [ ] Create `components/` module with:
  - `StockSymbolInput` - Validated symbol entry with suggestions
  - `DatePicker` - Business day validation and formatting
  - `PriceInput` - Currency formatting and validation
  - `QuantityInput` - Integer validation with limits
  - `MessageDisplay` - Success/error/info notifications
  - `DataTable` - Consistent table formatting
  - `FormLayout` - Standard form structure
- [ ] Add component documentation and examples
- [ ] Implement component testing utilities

## Notes

- **Testing**: Each phase requires comprehensive testing before progression
- **Documentation**: User documentation should be updated with each feature
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Database migrations required for schema changes
- **Performance**: Monitor application performance as features are added
- **Security**: Regular security reviews, especially for multi-user features

**Estimated Timeline**: 3-4 months for full implementation (assuming part-time development)
