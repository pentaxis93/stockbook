### Benefits Achieved:
1. **Reduced dependencies**: Removed ~20 packages (including transitive dependencies)
2. **Security improvements**: Latest patches for all packages
3. **Performance**: NumPy 2.x offers significant performance improvements
4. **Cleaner dependency tree**: No more UI-specific packages in a backend service
5. **Better maintainability**: Fewer dependencies to track and update

### Next Steps:
1. Fix mypy errors (remove outdated type: ignore comments)
2. Install Python 3.13.5 when ready for system upgrade
3. Consider addressing pylint warnings about too many return statements
4. Update CI/CD pipelines to use new dependency versions

### Notes:
- FastAPI remains at 0.115.13 (latest stable)
- Pydantic remains at 2.11.7 (latest stable)
- All critical dependencies are now at their latest stable versions
- The codebase is ready for Python 3.13 upgrade when system installation is complete
