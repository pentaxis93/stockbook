DEPRECATED: Legacy UI component tests.

These tests have been replaced by clean architecture presentation layer tests
as part of the clean architecture migration.

The legacy UI components in components.py have been removed in favor of
framework-agnostic UI operation interfaces with proper dependency injection.

# TODO: Remove this file completely after legacy cleanup is confirmed working
# The clean architecture presentation tests provide better coverage of UI logic
